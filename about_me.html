    <p>One of my favorite trips that I've gone on in the past few years was a journey through the Pacific Northwest with my girlfriend.
        We flew from Boston to Portland, Oregon, started at a Japanese garden, explored the city that feels like a bunch of suburbs smashed together,
         and enjoyed a peaceful sunset overlooking some train tracks with a close friend from high school.
        From there we drove a rental car (a Mitsubishi that I grew quite fond of) to Mt. Rainier, which was probably my favorite leg of the trip.
         The skyline trail was a huge highlight, as we got to see the mountain's enormity up close.
        Then it was off to Forks, to see Olympic National Park, and ensure locals we were not there for our Twilight fandom.
        Finally, the trip concluded in Seattle, where my housemate from undergrad was kind enough to let us stay at his apartment.
         We met his dog, Walnut, tried some ciders, and admired a sculpture garden before our red-eye back to the east.</p>

    One of my favorite restaurants from my hometown is <a href="https://www.fresconeedham.com" target="_blank">Fresco</a>. It's a pretty classic diner, 
    nothing too special about it other than the fond memories I have of coming here with my family and friends. 
    The food won't blow anyone away, but is consistently very good.

    Burritos are one of my favorite foods. I don't usually make them but they have been a staple in my life since I was a little kid living in Brookline, MA. 
    They may be a boring or unoriginal answer, but I find that they are almost always satisfying, delicious, easy to eat, and are usually customizable enough
     to accomodate for any food preferences. I typically prefer when there is no sour cream or cheese on top of the burrito, as I like to be able to eat them
    in a handheld manner. Fork and knife works too but tends to slightly lessen my enjoyment of the burrito.</p>

			<td>Douglas Adams</td>
			<td>A fairly normal human man explores the universe, trying to find the meaning of life. I love this book and series for its dry humor, 
                absurd tone, and underlying musings on our society.</td>

			<td>Andre Agassi</td>
			<td>An autobiography of an incredible tennis player, detailing his childhood, training for the sport, and his struggles with addiction.
                This book ignited my passion for autobiographies.

			<td>Kurt Vonnegut</td>
			<td>This book tells the tale of a soldier at war, with many time jumps, which can at times be confusing but I think add to the sensation of feeling lost
                and not understanding why said war is happening. Including this book feels a little cliche, but I vividly remember thouroughly enjoying it in high school,
                despite needing to write a book report on it.

			<td>Anthony Kiedis</td>
			<td>Another autobiography, this one being a pretty graphic telling of the life of the lead singer from Red Hot Chili Peppers. I have always 
                been interested in learning the meaning behind songs and/or how they were created, and I credit this book for getting me reinterested in
                reading after a lengthy hiatus.
